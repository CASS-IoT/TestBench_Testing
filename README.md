# TestBench_App


This branch is for practice and getting some About Announcement features set up. Eventually, the TestBench app should be fragment based, but I don't want to try learning how to do fragments just yet, so this simple setup should suffice for learning. And getting the useful bits of the sample AllJoyn apps organized. This will probably end up being a code reference.
